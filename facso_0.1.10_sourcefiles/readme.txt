Industry and miscellaneous tiles as objects, to expand and prettify/grungify your industrial areas. You don't need FIRS or CHIPS to use this NewGRF, but why wouldn't you use them?

*** NOTE ***
FaCso 0.1.8 AND LATER ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SAVEGAMES USING EARLIER VERSIONS OF THIS NEWGRF!
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

*** NEW IN 0.1.8 ***
Now with full support for 2CC! Massively increased the amount of objects in the set, with tons of new variations! Completely reworked code! Purchase menu now much more organized!

The decorative cargo tiles, fences and terrain transitions have been spun off into their own companion mod, called CIRso (CHIPS Industrial Renewal style objects). You can find it on BaNaNas or in the FaCso forum topic.

GRF Name: facso.grf

Graphics used: FIRS and CHIPS by andythenorth, FooBar, planetmaker, Terkhen, Yexo and many others.
This release does have a lot of my own sprite edits and variants, but it's all based on (and in the spirit of) the work of the people mentioned above!

Much gratitude to the people who have spent all these years coding, modding, spriting, developing and documenting.

Thanks to GarryG for uploading many of his Auz objects newGRF source files, which I learned quite a bit from.

Special shout outs to spnda, Gwyd and Erato on the openTTD Discord for helping me get started with openTTD modding!

AlexTheDacian, you are the hype king and I appreciate that so much. Thanks for sharing your screenshots featuring FaCso!
