This NewGRF adds a variety of apartment complexes buildable as industries, which generate passengers and mail and can be used to boost passenger generation or as eyecandy.

----------------------
2 Usage and Parameters
----------------------

The industry must be placed near towns, but you can use it to boost the numbers at passenger stations. Apartment complexes appear in a variety of styles and layouts, at random. They will not appear automatically on new maps but can be funded at any time.
If the setting "enable multiple similar industries per town" is enabled, many apartment complexes can be built close together, though be warned that will swamp you with too many passengers.

This GRF should be compatible with ECS, FIRS and most other industry sets. If you encounter any bugs or conflicts please report them to the development thread.

There is one parameter available. It disables the building placement restrictions, allowing apartment complexes to be built far from towns. This is useful for maps with very large towns or eyecandy oriented players.

Makefiles are hard, so this set does not yet have a proper makefile setup. Simply compile housing-ind.nml using the included batch file for now.
