Miscellaneous cargo tiles, ISR/DWE-style fences/pipelines and many transitional terrain tiles to mix and match your industrial areas. This is the companion mod to FaCso (FIRS and CHIPS style objects), but it can be used by itself.

Much gratitude to the people who have spent all these years coding, modding, spriting, developing and documenting.

Thanks to GarryG for uploading many of his Auz objects newGRF source files, which I learned quite a bit from.

Special shout outs to spnda, Gwyd and Erato on the openTTD Discord for helping me get started with openTTD modding!
