CHIPS Industrial Renewal style objects (CIRso) 0.1.10 CHANGELOG
====================================
	NewGRF by rotterdxm, based on graphics by the FIRS and ISR/DWE teams.
	Find me on tt-forums.net or on the OpenTTD Discord.

Miscellaneous cargo tiles, ISR/DWE-style fences and many transitional terrain tiles to mix and match your industrial areas. This is the companion mod to FaCso (FIRS and CHIPS style objects), but it can be used by itself.

=======
GRF Name: cirso.grf

----------------
Changelog
----------------
cirso_0.1.10:
*	Terrain-aware ISR pipelines added. Will look at making terrain transitions and fence crossings for these.

cirso_0.1.9:
*	Added the first set of ISR pipelines on dirt, concrete and cobblestone terrain.

cirso_0.1.8:
*	First main release. From now on, terrain objects, fences, cargo tiles and the like will go in this project rather than FaCso. Release number matches the first main FaCso release, which has had virtually its entire code completely overhauled.

cirso_0.0.1:
*	Split off this project from FIRS and CHIPS style objects (facso) because I was getting 	close to hitting the 256 object limit for newGRFs.
