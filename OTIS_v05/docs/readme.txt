====================================
One Tile Industry Set (OTIS)
====================================

=======
GRF Name : OTIS_v01

Made by Garry G, assisted by Quast65
Inspired by all industry-sets that have small industries, many thanks especially to the developers of FIRS.

This set is for the eyecandy players.

This version of OTIS is created with the idea that the games starts with no Industries available.

You have to buy and place the 1 tile representing the Industry you want.

Then you built your Industry using eye candy objects and non-track stations.

The one-tile industries can easily be hidden behind some nicer looking structures and then stimulate traffic to areas where you otherwise, for example because of the lack of housing, wouldn't have that.

There are just a couple of different industries, so you don't have to place loads close to each other.
But they accept and produce a lot of different cargo's, (up to 16 cargos) so you can have many different looking vehicles visiting them.

The plan is to eventually convert a couple of the well known industry-sets into objects.
So that you can have graphics from various sets, economies and/or climates in the same game.

The industries are funded only, so they wont spawn at the start (or during) a game, but they are very cheap.
So the player has total control over where they will be.


To make the game interesting:

1. Go to Setting and change the following:

2. Select:
- World generation:
- - Industry density: Funding Only.

3. Select
- Environment:
- - Industries:
- - - Manual primary industry construction method: As other industries
- - - Allow multi similar industries per town: On

The set has 8 Industries and 64 Cargo's.

Have fun!!
