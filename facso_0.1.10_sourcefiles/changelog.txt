Changelog
----------------
facso_0.1.10:
*	New inclusions: Ammonia and plastics plant sets completed and expanded (all 2CC). FIRS flour mill/plantation buildings (mediterranean style) in terrain-aware and cobblestone groundtile flavors; I created a lot of new variants I plan to add more misc. buildings in this category.
*	Fixed a few oversights, such as incorrect groundtypes for some buildings and purchase menu images not being lined up quite right.

facso_0.1.9:
*	Small update, added FIRS 4 cryo plant with some unused sprites and edits; added a few set of CHIPS/FIRS misc. small buildings (petrol stations, parcel offices, etc.). Added OpenGFX lumber mill and CHIPS grain silos.

facso_0.1.8:
*	First main release. All of the code has been redone and the purchase menu has been completely reorganized.
	THIS MEANS THERE IS NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WITH SAVEGAMES FROM OLDER FaCso VERSIONS.
	This release should be a stable platform and it's unlikely that I'll have to break backwards compatibility again.

*	Fences, terrain transitions and decorative cargo tiles have been spun off into their own newGRF, called CIRso (CHIPS Industrial Renewal style objects).

*	Many hundreds of new objects have been added across the dirt, concrete and cobblestone categories.
	A lot of these were done by yours truly, based on existing FIRS graphics.
	Most FIRS industrial buildings are available; farms and the like will come eventually, but are not a priority.

*	Second company color (2CC) support has been implemented across the board.

*	Purchase menu has been overhauled and consolidated. Most of the purchase menu items have 4 views, and most views have 3 to 4 randomized variants (sometimes less, rarely more).
	The purchase menu object description will mention if the object has 2CC support and/or randomized variations. Just keep clicking until you get what you want, ISR-style.

*	I've received a few comments about how some of the player colors are making some buildings "pop" too much. Others have asked whether I plan to include *all* player colors.
	As things stand, it's not likely. I don't have a solution for providing all player colors for all objects without:
		A. completely cluttering up the purchase menu
		B. and also running into the newGRF limit of 256 objects
	I might add some more neutrally-colored or toned-down versions of specific objects, and am open to requests.
	For now, I recommend choosing a less saturated color scheme for your primary and/or secondary company color.

*	Support for snow-aware buildings is in the works! For now, only the animated mine carts have this feature.
	Currently the plan is to start with the "dirt"-based set of objects (mines, lime kiln, copper refinery, pyrite smelter, steel mill, etc.).
	Snow-aware buildings will be rolled out *very* gradually. Not all FIRS industries are snow-aware; I'll be providing sprites back to FIRS when I need to create them.

facso_0.1.7:
*	Added clay pit, phosphate mine and quarry. The mining pit area is ground-aware.
	It will adapt to:
	* normal (grass)
	* desert (unfortunately not the transitional semi-desert/grass mixed tiles)
	* snow tiles (even changing with the seasons!)
*	Expanded tile choices for the above mines. Full water tiles included!
*	FIX: I did a stupid on the resource tiles.
	Many of the random concrete, cobblestone and snow tiles displayed as dirt. Oops.

facso_0.1.6:
*	Added cargo resource tiles from CHIPS for almost every resource (only items not included are farm animals and grain silos).
	They have their own subsection, and are available for all ground types (dirt, concrete, cobblestone and snow).
	Resource tiles come in 9 to 12 random variants each, with the smaller piles having a lower random chance to be selected when placing the object.

facso_0.1.5:
*	Added cobblestone buildings, such as the Iron Works, Textile Mill, Flour Mill, and many others.
*	Animated Steel Mill/Blast Furnace buildings added.
*	Started adding some CHIPS objects.
*	Made some more variants of existing FIRS objects.

facso_0.1.4:
*	Included all remaining mine buildings (Iron Ore, Pyrite, Potash, Manganese, Limestone). All have animated mine carts!
*	Added more buildings. Many new multi-tile objects, now also animated!
*	Started adding new objects from the FIRS 4 github w.i.p, more to come; thanks to andythenorth for sharing.
*	Made some new variants of existing objects, some also based on FIRS 4 material.

facso_0.1.3:
*	More tidying up of the NML.
*	Divided up buildings into dirt-tile and concrete-tile subsections, re-ordered some.
*	Added non-glitchy purchase menu images for multi-tile buildings.
*	Added changelog file.
*	Added credits and licensing.

facso_0.1.2 (unreleased):
*	Tidied up a lot of the NML.
*	Added experimental multi-tile objects.

facso_0.1.1:
*	Many more buildings added, some modular.

facso_0.1.0:
*	Tons of buildings added.

facso_0.0.3_test:
*	More buildings added.
*	Basic animations added for mine headgear towers.

facso_0.0.2:
*	More buildings added.
*	Switches added for multiple views.
*	Company color added for most buildings

facso_0.0.1_test:
*	Started out with the coal mine buildings. Not much going on here yet.

Much gratitude to the people who have spent all these years coding, modding, spriting, developing and documenting.

Thanks to GarryG for uploading many of his Auz objects newGRF source files, which I learned quite a bit from.

Special shout outs to spnda, Gwyd and Erato on the openTTD Discord for helping me get started with openTTD modding!

AlexTheDacian, you are the hype king and I appreciate that so much. Thanks for sharing your screenshots featuring FaCso!
